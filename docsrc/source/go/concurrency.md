# Go routines and channels

Go enables two styles of concurrent programming. 
* goroutines and channels, which support communicating sequential processes or CSP, a model of concurrency in which values are passed between independent activities (goroutines) but variables are for the most part confined to a single activity. 

* a more traditional model of shared memory multithreading, which will be familiar if youâ€™ve used threads in other mainstream languages. 

# Concurrency

Concurrency := Parts of the program may execure independently in some non-deterministic (partial) order 

* You can have concurrency with a single core processor - think interrupt handling in the os
* Concurrency is about dealing with things happening out-of-order

Parallelism := Parts of a program execute independently at the same time 
* parallelism can happen only on a multi-core processor
* Parallelism is about things actually happening at the same time
* We need concurrency to allow parts of the program to execute independently

Concurrency doesn't make the program faster, parallelism does. 
A single program won't have parallelism without concurrency

Race condition := System behavior depends on the (non-deterministic) sequence of timinig of parts of the program executing independently, where some possible behaviors (order of execurtion) produce invalid results

How to solve:
* don't share anything
* make the shared things read-only
* allow only one write to the shared things
* make the read-modify-write operations atomic (we are adding more (sequentual) order to our operations)
