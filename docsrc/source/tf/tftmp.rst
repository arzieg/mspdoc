Storage Account via gui (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-quick-create-use-windows)
    Under Azure services, select Storage accounts.

    Select + Create to create a storage account.

    Under Project details, select the Azure subscription in which to create the storage account. If you have only one subscription, it should be the default.

    If you want to create a new resource group, select Create new and enter a name such as myexamplegroup.

    Under Instance details, provide a name for the storage account. You might need to add a few random numbers to make it a globally unique name. A storage account name must be all lowercase and numbers, and must be between 3 and 24 characters. Make a note of your storage account name. You'll use it later.

    In Region, select the region you want to create your storage account in.

    In Performance, keep the default value of Standard.

    In Redundancy, select Locally redundant storage (LRS).
